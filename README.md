# CryptoLibraryToDebug

This project shall help you programming by giving you not only the results but also the intermediate values of multiple algorithms.
The code will not be optimized in any way except (hopefully) readability.

We do this mainly for fun and training, and because we experienced how difficult it can be
to implement a whole algorithm with only the final result as testing vectors.

Currently, this project is completely WIP.
