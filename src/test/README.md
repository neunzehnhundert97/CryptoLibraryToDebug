# Testbench

In this package you can find the testbenches used to verify the algorithms.
If available in the standard Java libaray, they are compared with this implementation,
if not, we used extern testing vectors.

## Hashing

Every algorithm that is available in Java is tested against 10 randomly genrated testinputs,
ranging from 0 to 10000 bytes input lengths
