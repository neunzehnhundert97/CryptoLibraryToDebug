# Why should you contribite?
We need your support to make this cryptographic library as good as possible!

Cryptographic algorithms are so complex and as we can see in the history of cryptographic algorithms, a little mistake
in the implementation has a high impact. So an we want to give you with this tool a good tool to check your implementations
and debug them.

But we are a team of two persons who implement many different cryptographic algorithms. So we can do mistakes. We test our
published work with testbenches and do thousands of tests before we are shure that the algorithm is implemented correctly.
But we are sure that we can not find all the little detail bugs. So if you think you have found a bug in our work please
contact us!

But even if you use our tool and want some new cool features. Please contact us with the following guideline.

## How report a bug
If you have found a bug or get an error. Please note down all the things you have done. For example if you opened the tool with
arguments, note down all the arguments! This is the easiest way for us to find out where the bug is ans how to fix it.

The next step for you is to post an issue on our GitHub-Issues page. Post a new issue where you say to us what you have done
and what error the tool showed you. Please mark this bug as a bug with a label in the right side in the issue menu.

## How to send us feedback about a new feature
If you want a new feature in our tool please oben a new issue and mark this issue with the "new feature label". Please
choose a compact title and describe the feature you want to have in the comment section as good as possible.
